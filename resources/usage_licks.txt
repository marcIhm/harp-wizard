OVERVIEW

  The mode 'licks' (similar to the mode 'quiz') is a game of challenge
  (the wise) and response (you).  Typically it plays a random lick
  from your collection and asks you to play it back note by note. If
  successful, the next lick will be chosen.

  This mode helps to learn and memorize licks.

  For harpwise, a 'lick' is a short musical phrase with a sequence of
  holes and an mp3-recording.
  
  Please Note: This mode relies on a collection of licks, that you
  need to accumulate over time; only a simple starter collection will
  be created at first start; tyypically it will be kept at:
  ~/.harpwise/licks/richter/licks_with_holes.txt

  This mode will set the scale to 'all' if no scale argument is given.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play licks from your collection; transpose them (i.e. recordings) to
  the key of c if necessary:
  
    ./harpwise licks c

  The same, but only choose from licks with tags 'fav' or 'scales'

    ./harpwise licks c --tags-any fav,scales

  There are a lot more options to filter the set of available licks
  (see below); see also the lick-file created initially on more
  explanation on the concept of tags.
  
  Here is a more sophisticated example. It helps to memorize licks,
  but only shorter ones and it shows the scales for each hole:

    ./harpwise licks c blues --loop --max-holes 15 --imm \
        --no-tags-any scales --disp chart-scales \
	--add-scales chord-i,chord-iv,chord-v \
        --comment holes-all

  Personally I have spend some money on some good lick collections
  (see the sample lick file for pointers), so that I have 50 or so
  licks, that just sound great in my ears.
