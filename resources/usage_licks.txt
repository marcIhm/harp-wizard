OVERVIEW

  The mode 'licks' (similar to the mode 'quiz') is a game of challenge
  (the wise) and response (you).  Typically it plays a random lick
  from your collection and asks you to play it back note by note. If
  successful, the next lick will be chosen.

  This mode helps to learn and memorize licks.

  For harpwise, a 'lick' is a short musical phrase with a sequence of
  holes and an mp3-recording.

  Please Note: This mode relies on a collection of licks, that you
  need to accumulate over time; only a simple starter set will
  be created at first start; tyypically it will be kept at:
  ~/.harpwise/licks/richter/licks_with_holes.txt

  When adding licks and need to adjust start and end of the recording,
  you may find the mode 'play' helpful, to check your results.

  Personally I have paid for some good lick collections (see the
  sample lick file for pointers), so that I have 50 or so licks, that
  really sound great in my ears.
  
USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play licks from your collection; transpose them (i.e. recordings) to
  the key of c, if necessary:
  
    ./harpwise licks c

  The same, but only choose from licks with tags 'fav' or 'scales'

    ./harpwise licks c --tags-any fav,scales

  Show the licks selected by the previous example:

    ./harpwise licks c --tags-any fav,scales -s print

  Show the same with mode play:
  
    ./harpwise play print --tags-any fav,scales

  There are a lot more options to *filter* the set of available licks
  (see below); see also the lick-file created initially on more
  explanation on the concept of tags.
  
  Here is a more sophisticated example. It helps to memorize licks,
  but only shorter ones and it shows the scales for each hole:

    ./harpwise licks c blues --loop --max-holes 15 --imm \
        --no-tags-any scales --disp chart-scales \
	--add-scales chord-i,chord-iv,chord-v \
        --comment holes-all
