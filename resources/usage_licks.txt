OVERVIEW

  The mode 'licks' (similar to the mode 'quiz') is a game of challenge
  (the wise) and response (you).  Typically it plays a random lick
  from your collection and asks you to play it back note by note. If
  successful, the next lick will be challenged.

  This mode helps to learn and memorize licks.

  For harpwise, a 'lick' is a short musical phrase with a sequence of
  holes and an mp3-recording. It will be transposed as necessary.

  Please Note: This mode relies on a collection of licks, that you
  need to accumulate over time; only a simple starter set will
  be created at first start; typically it will be kept at:
  ~/.harpwise/licks/richter/licks_with_holes.txt

  When adding licks and need to adjust start and end of the recording,
  you may find the mode 'play' helpful, to check your results.

  Personally I have paid for some good lick collections (see the
  sample lick file for pointers), so that I have 50 or so licks, that
  really sound great for me.

  If you get comfortable with a lick and want to explore it beyond its
  written wholes, you may find it useful to switch to mode listen,
  which can be done by typing 'm' without stopping the wise first.
  
USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play licks from your collection; transpose them (i.e. their
  recordings) to the key of c, if necessary:
  
    harpwise licks c

  The same, but only choose from licks with tags 'fav' or 'scales'

    harpwise licks c --tags-any fav,scales

  Show the licks selected by the previous example, employing the
  mode 'report':

    harpwise report licks --tags-any fav,scales

  Select licks, that have been starred:

    harpwise licks a -t starred

  use mode report to see details about starred licks.
  
  There are some more options to *filter* the set of available licks
  (see below); see also the lick-file created initially on more
  explanation on the concept of tags.
  
  Here is a more sophisticated example. It helps to memorize licks,
  but not scales and shows the scales for each hole:

    harpwise licks c blues --loop --imm --no-tags-any scales \
        --add-scales chord-i,chord-iv,chord-v \
        --display chart-scales --comment holes-all

  However, if you find yourself using these options for mode licks
  over and over again, you may move them to your config.ini and
  shorten the above command line to:

    harpwise licks blues
