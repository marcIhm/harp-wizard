You will need to add more licks (with recordings), before the mode
'licks' can really be useful.

To get started you may search the web.  Make sure, to grep audio
samples too or record them yourself. For example, see

  https://www.harmonica.com/6-blues-riffs

for a handful of great licks.


Much more extensive are these two books with lots of licks,
complete with audio samples:

- "100 Authentic Blues Harmonica Licks" by Steve Cohen

- "100 Easy Blues Harmonica Licks" by Yvonnick Prene 


Also, Liam Ward has useful collections of licks for various skill
levels at:

Not beeing commercially connected with any of these offerings, I found
these paid source invaluable in collecting the 60 or so favorite licks,
that I am practicing regularly.

Note, that When adding licks to this file by copying them from a book or
from the web, you probably will need to adjust the notation for holes;
let the initial error messages be your guide or look at the file
<%= "#{$dirs[:install]}/config/richter/holes.yaml" %>
