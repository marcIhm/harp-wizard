OVERVIEW

  The mode 'play' picks from the command line: holes, notes or licks;
  it may play multiple holes but cannot mix them with e.g. licks.

  Its arguments can be any of:

    - holes (e.g. '-1')
    - licks (e.g. 'st-louis')
    - special values (e.g. 'l', '2l) to reference e.g. the last lick
    - keywords (e.g. 'random' or 'cycle'), that influence, what and
      how licks are played
    - keyword 'pitch' to play an interactive, adjustable pitch; this
      may help to find the key of a song by ear-comparison
    
  This mode needs no scale argument.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play a few holes on a harp of key c:

    harpwise play c +1 -2 c4

  Play the lick 'wade'; transpose it to d:
  
    harpwise play d wade

  Play a single random lick:

    harpwise play random

  Lick-Radio: Play all my licks in random order without end:

    harpwise play random cycle

  Play an earlier lick:

    harpwise play 3l


  The special keywords (e.g. 'iter' or 'rand') are the same, that
  may appear in option --start-with in mode (e.g.) licks; see there
  for more examples.
  

  Play an interactive, adjusable pitch:

    harpwise play pitch

  this may help to find the key of a song that is playing: change the
  pitch by semitones, fiths or octaves until both match.

    harpwise play pitch c

  Exactly the same result as above, but with the key of c given
  explicit. This will actually start of playing g, the root note in
  second position (cross-harp).

  Note: As an alternative, you may try to humm the root note or tonal
  center of the song to find its key. Which is the preferred method,
  because it does not need a computer; but this command may help to
  get you started anyway.
