OVERVIEW

  The mode 'play' picks from the command line: holes, notes, licks or
  special keywords.  It may play multiple holes but cannot mix them
  with e.g. licks.

  Its arguments can be any of:

    - holes (e.g. '-1')
    - licks (e.g. 'st-louis')
    - 'l', '2l', for the last lick, 2nd-to-last, etc.
    - 'licks' for selected licks
    - 'pitch' to play an interactive, adjustable pitch; this
      may help to find the key of a song by ear-comparison
    - 'interval': play an interval specified on the commandline
    - 'progression': take a base and semitone diffs, then play it

  You may try 'harpwise play x' for an instructive error message.

  This mode needs no scale argument.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play a few holes on a harp of key c:

    harpwise play c +1 -2 c4

  Play the lick 'wade'; transpose it to d:
  
    harpwise play d wade

  Lick-Radio: Play all my licks in random order without end:

    harpwise play licks

  or play them one after another:

    harpwise play licks --iterate cycle

  Only play favorite licks (tag 'fav'):

    harpwise play licks --tags-any fav

  Play an earlier lick:

    harpwise play 3l

  To see a list of earlier licks:

    harpwise report history


  The special keywords (e.g. 'iter' or 'rand') are the same, that
  may appear in option --start-with in mode (e.g.) licks; see there
  for more examples.
  

  Play an interactive, adjusable pitch:

    harpwise play pitch

  this may help to find the key of a song that is playing: change the
  pitch by semitones, fiths or octaves until both match.

    harpwise play pitch c

  Exactly the same result as above, but with the key of c given
  explicit. This will actually start of playing g, the root note in
  second position (cross-harp).

  Note: As an alternative, you may try to humm the root note or tonal
  center of the song to find its key. Which is the preferred method,
  because it does not need a computer; but this command may help to
  get you started anyway.


  Play an interval:

    harpwise play inter c4 d4

  while this is beeing played you may move it around or widen or
  narrow it by semitones.

  There are multiple ways to specify an interval:
  - Either as two notes or holes
  - Or as one note or hole plus one interval (named or as semitones)

  So these are more ways to play an interval:

    harpwise play inter c4 12st    ## Note c4 and 12 Semitones

    harpwise play inter +2 pf      ## Hole +2 and a perfect fifth

  The error message (if any) will list valid values.


  Play a note progression:

    harpwise play prog e3 7st 9st oct

  this plays the classic box pattern interactively, you may loop it or
  shift it by semitones. Holes for the harmonica (if any) are printed
  along.

  You may want to use the box pattern and the interactive features of
  'harpwise play prog' to play (sort of) a full 12-bar blues: Start
  with the progression above and let it repeat 4 times (i.e. for 4
  bars); this is the i-chord. Then shift by 5 Semitones up (or 7
  down), to get the iv-chord, and let this play another two times;
  then 5 semitones down to get the i-chord again, etc., etc. until 12
  bars have been played.

  Alternatively, you may get a similar result by playing predefined
  chords. As harpwise comes with prebuild licks of the 'box pattern'
  for chords i, iv and v, you may ask the wise to play the base-line
  of a 12-bar blues like this:

  harpwise play box-i box-i box-i box-i box-iv box-iv box-i box-i box-v box-iv box-i simple-turn

  which also uses the lick simple-turn at the end.
