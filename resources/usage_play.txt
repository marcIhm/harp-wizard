OVERVIEW

  The mode 'play' picks from the commandline: holes, notes or licks;
  it may play multiple holes but cannot mix them with e.g. licks.

  Its arguments can be any of:

    - holes (e.g. '-1')
    - licks (e.g. 'juke')
    - special values (e.g. 'l', '2l) to reference e.g. the last lick
    - keywords (e.g. 'random' or 'cycle'), that influence, what and
      how licks are played
    
  This mode needs no scale argument.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play a few holes on a harp of key c:

    harpwise play c +1 -2+3 c4

  Play the lick 'juke'; transpose it to d:
  
    harpwise play d juke

  Play a single random lick:

    harpwise play random

  Lick-Radio: Play all my licks in random order without end:

    harpwise play random cycle

  Play an earlier lick:

    harpwise play 3l


  The special keywords (e.g. 'iter' or 'rand') are the same, that
  may appear in option --start-with in mode (e.g.) licks; see there
  for more examples.
