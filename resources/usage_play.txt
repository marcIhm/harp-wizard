OVERVIEW

  The mode 'play' picks from the command line: holes, notes or licks;
  it may play multiple holes but cannot mix them with e.g. licks.

  Its arguments can be any of:

    - holes (e.g. '-1')
    - licks (e.g. 'st-louis')
    - 'l', '2l', for the last lick, 2nd-to-last, etc.
    - 'all-licks' for all licks
    - 'pitch' to play an interactive, adjustable pitch; this
      may help to find the key of a song by ear-comparison
    
  This mode needs no scale argument.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play a few holes on a harp of key c:

    harpwise play c +1 -2 c4

  Play the lick 'wade'; transpose it to d:
  
    harpwise play d wade

  Lick-Radio: Play all my licks in random order without end:

    harpwise play all-licks

  or play them one after another:

    harpwise play all-licks --iterate cycle

  Only play favorite licks (tag 'fav'):

    harpwise play all-licks --tags-any fav

  Play an earlier lick:

    harpwise play 3l

  To see a list of earlier licks:

    harpwise report history


  The special keywords (e.g. 'iter' or 'rand') are the same, that
  may appear in option --start-with in mode (e.g.) licks; see there
  for more examples.
  

  Play an interactive, adjusable pitch:

    harpwise play pitch

  this may help to find the key of a song that is playing: change the
  pitch by semitones, fiths or octaves until both match.

    harpwise play pitch c

  Exactly the same result as above, but with the key of c given
  explicit. This will actually start of playing g, the root note in
  second position (cross-harp).

  Note: As an alternative, you may try to humm the root note or tonal
  center of the song to find its key. Which is the preferred method,
  because it does not need a computer; but this command may help to
  get you started anyway.
