OVERVIEW

  The mode 'play' picks from the command line: holes, notes or licks;
  it may play multiple holes but cannot mix them with e.g. licks.

  Its arguments can be any of:

    - holes (e.g. '-1')
    - licks (e.g. 'st-louis')
    - special values (e.g. 'l', '2l) to reference e.g. the last lick
    - keywords (e.g. 'random' or 'cycle'), that influence, what and
      how licks are played
    - the special keyword 'key-of-song' to play a tone with adjustable
      pitch; this is intended to find the key of a song by
      ear-comparison
    
  This mode needs no scale argument.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play a few holes on a harp of key c:

    harpwise play c +1 -2 c4

  Play the lick 'wade'; transpose it to d:
  
    harpwise play d wade

  Play a single random lick:

    harpwise play random

  Lick-Radio: Play all my licks in random order without end:

    harpwise play random cycle

  Play an earlier lick:

    harpwise play 3l


  The special keywords (e.g. 'iter' or 'rand') are the same, that
  may appear in option --start-with in mode (e.g.) licks; see there
  for more examples.
  

  Play an adjusable pitch:

    harpwise play key-of-song

  try this while listening to a song to find its key by comparing the
  song to this pitch.

    harpwise play key c

  Exactly the same result as above, but with explicitly sepcified key
  of c. This will play two draw on a c-harp, which is g, because one
  would normally use a c-harp to play a song in g.

  Note: As an alternative, you may try to humm the "central note" or
  "tonal center" of the song to find its key. This is the preferred
  method, because it does not need a computer. But this command may
  help to get started anyway.
