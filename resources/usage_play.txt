OVERVIEW

  The mode 'play' builds no fancy display and is not interactive; it
  rather plays, what you specify on the commandline; this can be 
  any of:

    - holes
    - licks
    - special values (e.g. 'l', '2l) to reference e.g. the last lick
    - keywords (e.g. 'random' or 'cycle'), that influence, how licks
      are played
    - the keyword 'print', that just gives information about licks
    
  This mode needs no scale argument.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Play a few holes on a harp of key c:

    ./harpwise play c +1 -2+3 c4

  Play the lick 'juke'; transpose it to d:
  
    ./harpwise play d juke

  Play a single random lick:

    ./harpwise play random

  Lick-Radio: Play all my licks in random order without end:

    ./harpwise play random cycle

  Show info about licks; add filter option to select a subset:

    ./harpwise play print
