OVERVIEW

  The mode 'play' builds no fancy display and is not interactive; it
  rather plays, what you specify on the commandline; this can be any
  of:

    - holes
    - licks
    - special values to reference e.g. the last lick
    - Not play anything, but give information about licks
    
  This mode needs no scale argument.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES
