This is an interactive assistant, that will ask to play these <%=holes.length%> holes
of your harmonica, key of <%=$key%>, one after the other:

  <%="\e[32m#{holes.each_slice(12).to_a.map{|s| s.join('  ')}.join("\n  ")}\e[0m"%>

Any existing recording will be <%="\e[34m"%>analysed<%="\e[0m"%> and presented for <%="\e[34m"%>review<%="\e[0m"%> first.
Then you may <%="\e[34m"%>record<%="\e[0m"%> a new sample and <%="\e[34m"%>trim<%="\e[0m"%> it (cut off initial silence).
This will then <%="\e[34m"%>repeat<%="\e[0m"%> for all holes.

You may invoke this assistant again at any later time, just to review
your recorded samples and maybe correct some of them.  Results are
written to disk immediately, so you may interrupt the process (ctrl-c)
after any hole. Later, to start again from a specific hole, give it as
a commandline argument.

<%="\e[2m"%>Remark: if you just want to get started quickly, you may
interrupt (ctrl-c) and skip this assistant for now with:
   harpwise samples <%=$key%> generate
and come back to 'record' later, maybe for some holes only.<%="\e[0m"%>
