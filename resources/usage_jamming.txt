Overview:

  'jamming' relies on the existing mode 'listen' and the script jamming.rb
  to provide impulse and a runway for improvisation. For this it includes a
  backing-track as well as matching sets of lick and chords.


Usage by Example:

  You may invoke:

    harpwise jamming

  which takes no arguments and simply issues its usage-message (which you
  are reading right now).

  Read on for minimum background and for easy-to-follow instructions.
  
  The script jamming.rb is a remote control and helper for harpwise that
  plays a backing-track while making harpwise switch licks and chords
  (scales). This happens in time with the chord-changes of the track (by
  means of a time-table).

  To use jamming.rb with harpwise, you need *two* terminals. In the first one start e.g.:

    harpwise listen c --sc-prog 12bar --lick-prog box1 --read-fifo

  after that, in the second terminal run:

    harpwise jamming 12bar

  The argument '12bar' is treated as a filename; it is expandeded to '12bar.json' and
  searched in various directories (for details, let remarks and errors be your guide).

  The file '12bar.json' contains the required settings (e.g. location of the backing track)
  and has many comments, that can help to understand its content. This is not needed
  initially but becomes essential if you want to use your own backing-tracks or licks.

  Once started, harpwise (as usual) shows your playing on the
  harmonica-chart and indicates, how it matches the current chord; all
  with respect to the backing track beeing played. The scale-progression
  '12bar' is really a chord-progression (I,IV,V) and is switched along by
  jamming.rb. This script uses the timestamps from the file 12bar.json to
  trigger harpwise at the right moments.

  With the scripted chord-progression '12bar' you always see, which are
  the notes (holes) from the chord and may check easily, if you play
  within the current chord or not. In addition you have the licks of the
  lick-progression 'box1' (whose name comes from the box-pattern on
  guitar). These licks are switched along as the backing-track progresses
  (just like the chords). Start by playing the licks unil you feel in the
  mood for some improvisation, e.g. over the chords.

  Note, that in this accustic setup you may either need headphones or a
  hand-held microphone to keep apart your playing from the backing track
  beeing played. This saves harpwise from getting confused.


  If, over time, you have created multiple json-files with settings
  (e.g. different backing-tracks), you may use:

    harpwise jamming list

  to list them.
