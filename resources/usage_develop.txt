OVERVIEW

  This mode is only useful for the maintainer or developer of
  harpwise; it is therefore not listed in the general usage
  information.

  Its single argument specifies the task to perform and can be any of the keywords:
  
  - man, process harpwise.1.erb into harpwise.1 and show it as a man page
  - diff, compare man page produced as above with plain usage info, as
    they are maintained seperately. Result can be useful in git-hooks
