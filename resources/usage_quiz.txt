OVERVIEW

  The mode 'quiz' is a quiz on music theory and musical memory and
  comes in different flavours. It issues questions and asks for an
  answer. Some flavours involve holes beeing played either as part of
  the question or the answer.

  Every time you invoke harpwise with mode 'quiz', a flavour is
  chosen; to try another flavour, just restart harpwise.  For a chosen
  flavour, questions are posed in an endless loop.

  The known flavours are:

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  The wise chooses a quiz-flavour at random (key of c):

    harpwise quiz c random

  this is the preferred way to get used to this mode.
  

  Wise plays 3 notes from the scale major_pentatonic for a
  chromatic harmonica of key a and then asks you to play them
  back (then repeat):

    harpwise quiz replay 5 chromatic a blues

  In the examples above, the type of harmonica (e.g. richter or
  chromatic) and, in addition, the key (e.g. c or a) may be omitted
  and are then taken from the config; so

    harpwise q replay 5 major

  is valid as well (but would choose a richter harp).

  This example removes drawbends from the scale 'all':

    harpwise quiz all replay 5 --remove-scales drawbends

  this example also relies on the default of 5 holes to be played.


  Wise shuffles and plays a scale and asks you for its name:

    harpwise quit scale-shuffled
