OVERVIEW

  The mode 'quiz' is a game of challenge (the wise) and response
  (you).  Typically it plays a random sequence of holes and asks you
  to play it back. If successful, the next sequence will be chosen.

  This mode helps to train your musical memory.

  The mode requires an additional argument at second place, stating
  the length of the sequence.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  The Wise plays 3 notes from the scale major_pentatonic for a
  chromatic harmonica of key a and then quizzes you to play them
  back (then repeat):

    harpwise quiz 3 chrom a major_pentatonic

  In the examples above, the type of harmonica (e.g. richter or
  chromatic) and, in addition, the key (e.g. c or a) may be omitted
  and are then taken from the config; so

    harpwise q 3 major

  is valid as well (but would choose a richter harp).

  This example removes drawbends from all notes:

    harpwise quiz 3 all --remove-scales drawbends
