OVERVIEW

  The mode 'listen' shows information on the notes you play; depending
  on settings for display and comment, this can be:

    - Hole
    - Note
    - Interval to previous note
    - Difference to a defined reference note, e.g. to train bends
    - Membership of played note in various scales

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  The wise listens, while your are playing a richter (abbreviated as
  'ri') harp of key c and it shows the holes, that you played; green
  if from the scale, red otherwise:

  The same but also show the notes from the one-chord (chord-i):
