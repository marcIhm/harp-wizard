OVERVIEW

  The mode 'listen' shows information on the notes you play; depending
  on settings for display and comment this can be:

    - Hole
    - Note
    - Interval to previous note
    - Difference to a reference note, e.g. to practice bends
    - Membership of played note in various scales

  When playing, you may switch on journal to get a simple
  transcription of the holes played.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  The wise listens, while your are playing a richter (abbreviated as
  'ri') harp of key c and it shows the holes, that you played; green
  if from the scale, red otherwise:

    harpwise listen ri c blues

  The same, but relying on the defaults:

    harpwise listen blues

  The same, but also showing the notes from the one-chord (chord-i):

    harpwise listen blues --add-scales chord-i --display chart-scales

  If you find harpwise sluggish or if you get a warning on lagging and
  lost samples, you may want to experiment with --time-slice:

    harpwise listen c --time-slice 0.1
