OVERVIEW

  The mode 'report' show helps to select licks by tags and shows what
  you played.
  
  Its single argument can be any of the keywords:

    - licks, to show and group licks and tags, so that you may select
      them with the various tag-options (e.g. --tags-any). This report
      has two seperate sections:
      - Licks selected by the tag-options
      - Any and all licks, disregarding any options
    - journal, to show, which licks you played recently in modes licks
      or play
    - dump, dump all the licks in json-format (for advanced use)
    
  This mode needs no scale argument.

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Report licks with tags 'fav' first, and then all

    ./harpwise report licks -t fav

  ,which is the same as:
  
    ./harpwise report richter licks -t fav

  If you have collected licks for the chromatic harmonica, you may
  also use:

    ./harpwise report chromatic licks -t fav

  Show what you have played recently along with shortcuts 'l', '2l', ...
  
    ./harpwise report journal
