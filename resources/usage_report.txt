OVERVIEW

  The mode 'report' show helps to select licks by tags and shows what
  you played.
  
  Its single argument can be any of the keywords:

    - licks, to show and group licks and tags, so that you may select
      them with the various tag-options (e.g. --tags-any)
    - all-licks, overview for all known licks, regardless of options
      or config
    - history, to show, which licks you played recently in modes licks
      or play
    - starred, to show all starred licks with their respective number
      of stars
    - dump, dump all the licks in json-format (for advanced use)
    
  This mode needs no scale argument.

  To get content of individual licks or scales or simply a list of
  their names, you may also try the mode: harpwise print

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Report licks with tags 'fav' first, and then all

    harpwise report licks -t fav

  which is the same as:
  
    harpwise report richter licks -t fav

  If you have collected licks for the chromatic harmonica, you may
  also use:

    harpwise report chromatic licks -t fav

  Show the licks you played recently along with their shortcuts 'l',
  '2l', ...
  
    harpwise report history

  List all the licks, that you have starred:

    harpwise report starred

  Remark: In other modes you may access these licks through the
  tag 'starred', which they get assigned automatically.
