OVERVIEW

  The mode 'print' takes its arguments (holes, notes, licks or special
  keywords) and prints their hole-content on the commandline.

  If you specify a scale (optional) too, the scale-membership of the
  the notes will be shown.

  Its argument can be any of:

    - holes (e.g. '-1')
    - licks (e.g. 'st-louis')
    - keyword 'all-licks'
    - scales (e.g. 'chord-i')
    - 'list-all-scales': a list of all scales
    - 'list-all-licks': a list of all licks
    - 'licks' details on all licks selected (e.g. by --tags-any)

  You may try 'harpwise print x' for an instructive error message.

  And try 'harpwise report' to get some more detailed reports on licks
  and scales.
