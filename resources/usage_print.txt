OVERVIEW

  The mode 'print' takes its arguments (holes, notes, licks or special
  keywords) and prints their hole-content on the commandline.

  If you specify a scale (optional) too, the scale-membership of the
  the notes will be shown.

  Its argument can be any of:

    - holes (e.g. '-1')
    - licks (e.g. 'st-louis')
    - scales (e.g. 'chord-i')
    - 'list-all-scales': a list of all scales
    - 'list-all-licks': a list of all licks
    - 'licks': details on all licks selected (e.g. by --tags-any)
    - 'progression': take a base and semitone diffs, then spell it out
    - 'interval': print an interval with the given
       notes/holes/semitone-diff

  You may try 'harpwise print x' for an instructive error message.

  And try 'harpwise report' to get some more detailed reports on licks
  and scales.
  
USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Print holes and notes of a lick:

    harpwise print st-louis
    
  Print holes and notes of a scale (blues):

    harpwise print blues

  Print the scales, each note belongs to too:

    harpwise print chord-i feeling-bad --add-scales chord-iv,chord-v

  Print the major pentatonic scale but shift it down by 7 semitones;
  prepare for the case, that there might be a lick with the same name:

    harpwise print mape --transpose-scale -7st --scale-over-lick

  nearly the same result can be achieved by

    harpwise print mape

  and then take these holes as input for tools:

    harpwise tools shift -7st -2 -3// -3 -4 +5 +6

  just print a list of all known licks:

    harpwise print list-all-licks

  Print details for favorite licks:

    harpwise print licks --tags-any favorites

  (if you have tagged some licks as favorites)
 
  Print an interval

    harpwise print interval c4 oct

  Print a tone progression:

    harpwise print prog e3 7st 9st oct
    
  (for prog and inter, see mode 'play' for more details)
