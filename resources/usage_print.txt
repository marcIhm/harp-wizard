OVERVIEW

  The mode 'print' takes its arguments (holes, notes or licks) and
  prints their hole-content on the commandline.

  If you specify a scale (optional) too, the scale-membership of the
  the notes will be shown.

  Its arguments can be any of:

    - holes (e.g. '-1')
    - licks (e.g. 'st-louis')
    - keyword 'all-licks'
    - scales (e.g. 'chord-i')

  how you use them, you may also try the mode: harpwise report
