This is an interactive assistant, that will ask you to play these
holes of your harmonica, key of <%=$key%>, one after the other:

  <%="\e[32m#{$harp_holes.each_slice(12).to_a.map{|s| s.join('  ')}.join("\n  ")}}\e[0m"%>

See remark on option '--auto' below, if you want to skip this for now.

Any existing recording will be presented first for review. Then you
may start a new recording and trim it (cut of initial silence). This
will be repeated for all holes.

After all holes have been recorded, a table of all frequencies will be
printed, so that you may do a final check of your recordings.

You may invoke this assistant again at any later time, just to review
your recorded notes and maybe correct some of them.  Results are
written to disk immediately, so you may end the process after any
hole. To start from a specific hole, use option '--hole'.

The harp, that you are going to use for calbration, should be the one,
that you will use for your later practice.

The recorded samples will be used to determine the frequencies of your
particular instrument and will be played back in mode 'quiz'.

Remark: if you just want to get started with harpwise quickly, you may
skip this process by starting calibrate with the option '--auto'; any
later time you catch up.

If you find the volume of the synth sounds from '--auto' too low or high,
you may try to tweak the option auto_synth_db in your config.ini.
