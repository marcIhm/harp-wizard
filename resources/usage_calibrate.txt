OVERVIEW

  The wise needs a set of audio-samples; these are the sounds-files
  (recorded or generated) of each of the holes for one second;
  blow, draw, bend.
  
  The samples are used to:
  
  - play a series of holes, e.g. for modes play or recall
  - judge the frequencies of your playing against the frequencies of the
    samples to find out, which note you are actually playing

  You may either record those samples under the guidance of this mode,
  or you may let the wise generate them for you (see option '--auto'
  below).

  The samples need to be generated for each key, but only once in the
  lifetime of your harp; you may start with the key of c only.
  After that you are ready to use the other modes of the wise.

  By its nature, this mode only accepts arguments for type and key,
  but not for scale.
  

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Calibrate the wise for the frequencies of the harp you are using:

    harpwise calibrate c

  this will ask you to play notes on your harp. The samples will be
  stored in the hidden folder .harpwise within your home
  directory; frequencies will be extracted to the file frequencies.yaml.


  Automatic calibration is the fastest way to get your set of samples:
  The wise creates all the audio samples (using sox) for you; however
  this cannot match the characteristics of your own harp and your own
  playing style, but gives a good quick start.  To use auto
  calibration, type:

    harpwise calibrate c --auto


  To calibrate a single hole only (for key of a):

    harpwise calibrate a --hole -3//
