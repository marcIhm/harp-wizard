OVERVIEW

  The wise needs a set of audio-samples; these are the sounds-files
  (recorded or generated) of each of the holes for one second;
  blow, draw, bend.
  
  The samples are used to:
  
  - play a series of wholes, that you should remember (e.g. for mode quiz)
  - judge the frequencies of your playing against the frequencies of the
    samples to find out, which note you are actually playing

  You may either record those samples under the guidance of this mode,
  or you may let the wise generate them for you (see option '--auto'
  below).

  The samples need to be generated for each key, but only once in the
  lifetime of your harp; you may start with the key of c only.
  After that you are ready to use the other modes of the wise.

  By its nature, this mode only accepts arguments for type and key,
  but not for scale.
  

USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Calibrate the wise for the frequencies of the harp you are using:

    harpwise calibrate c

  this will ask you to play notes on your harp. The samples will be
  stored in the hidden folder .harpwise within your home
  directory; frequencies will be extracted to the file frequencies.yaml.


  For automatic calibration (you will not need to play, sounds will be
  synthesized; but results may be inaccurate) you may use:

    harpwise calibrate c --auto

  which will get you started with harpwise quickly.


  To calibrate a single hole only (for key a):

    harpwise calibrate a --hole -3//
