  interval, inter: |
    interactive, adjustable interval given as arguments
  progression, prog: |
    take a base and some semitone diffs, then play it

    search given sequence of holes (or equiv) among licks; the same
    ordering of holes is required
  search-in-scales: |
    search given lick or sequence of holes (or equiv) among scales;
    ordering of holes is not important
  search-scale-in-licks: |

  edit-licks: |
    invoke editor on your lickfile

quiz:
  all, ran, random: |
    all flavours, one at random

    flavours related with scales at random
  microphone: |
    flavour that use your microphone and switche to listen-perspective
  silent: |
    flavours that can be tried with muted speakers
  choose: |
    choose flavour right away
  players: |
    harpwise shows details about a famous player and asks for his or
    her name
  hear-scale: |
    harpwise plays the holes of a scale and asks for its name
  not-in-scale: |
    harpwise chooses a scale at random and modifies it: holes are
    shuffled and one is replaced with a foreign hole; this modified
    scale is played and you should find the foreign hole. The holes
    are disguised as h1, h2, and so on. Help allows to compare the
    modified scale with the original, either shuffled or ascending
  match-scale: |
    plays a random sequence of holes, that are either a subset of one
    or many scales and asks for the name of the single or shortest
    scale containing all these holes
  play-scale: |
    gives the name of a scale and asks to play it
  hear-inter: |
    plays an interval and asks for its name
  add-inter: |
    gives a hole and an interval and asks for the resulting hole,
    which is obtained by either adding or subtracting
  play-inter: |
    names a hole and an interval which resolves to a hole; then asks
    to play back both holes
  tell-inter: |
    wise names two holes and asks for the interval between
  hear-key: |
    plays a sequence of notes starting from a random key (i.e. its
    base-note); asks for this key (rather than for the matching
    harmonica)
  play-shifted: |
    wise computes a sequence of holes, that can be shifted by an
    interval; it plays the original unshifted sequence and names and
    plays the first hole of the shifted sequence; then you should play
    BOTH the unshifted and shifted sequence together
  key-harp-song: |
    gives a key of harmonica and asks for the matching
    key of song (2nd position) or vice versa
  hole-note: |
    gives a hole and asks for the note or vice versa
  keep-tempo: |
    plays a number of beats defining a certain tempo; then some
    silence and then some final beats. You are expected to play along
    and keep the given tempo throughout; harpwise records your playing
    and checks, how well you kept the tempo
  hear-tempo: |
    plays a tempo and asks for its bpm
  replay: |
    harpwise plays a sequence of holes and asks you to play it back
