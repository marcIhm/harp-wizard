harpwise ('wise' for short) supports the daily practice of bends,
scales, intervals or licks on a diatonic (richter) or chromatic
harmonica for various keys.

The wise recognizes single notes, that you play and it may play chords
for you (but does not recognize your chords); rhythm is out of its
scope entirely.

When invoking harpwise, the first argument on the command line
specifies the mode of operation; it can be one of:

  - listen: The wise listens to your playing, e.g. to monitor bends or
    scales
  - licks: Learn licks (only a few included, but some pointers for you
    to add more)
  - quiz: Train your ear and musical memory

And with a less interactive interface and not using your microphone:

  - play: Wise plays scales, holes or licks, not asking you to play
    them back
  - print: Print and annotate the holes of scales or licks given
    on the commandline
  - report: Produce reports about licks and tags or a journal of licks
    played
  - tools: Some simple, non-interactive tools related to basic
    harmonica theory
  - calibrate: Wise generates samples for holes, or assists in
    recording your own; this is a prereq to using many other modes;
    you will be asked to invoke it, when necessary

to read more details, usage examples and options for the individual
modes, invoke them without arguments, e.g.

  harpwise listen


After the first argument (which specifies the mode) some additional
arguments may be given:

  - type: mostly 'richter' or 'chromatic' but other choices might be
    defined. If omitted, this defaults to 'richter'.

  - key: key of harp, e.g. 'c' or 'g' or 'af' (a flat) or
    'ds' (d sharp). If omitted, this defaults to 'c'.

  - scale: scale on which you want to concentrate, e.g. 'blues',
    'major_pentatonic' or 'all'. No default.

An example using all these arguments would be:

  harpwise listen richter c blues

,which (relying on defaults), could also be written as:

  harpwise listen blues

(listen to your playing, while marking notes from the blues-scale)


The possible scales depend on the chosen type of harmonica:

Besides the arguments for type, key and scale, there are a lot of
options (introduced by '-'), some requiring an argument themselves.
All options are described in the usage info of the various modes.

Most arguments and options can be abbreviated, e.g 'lis' for 'listen',
'cal' for 'calibrate' or '-t' for '--tags-any'.

Also note, that for most modes, the behaviour (e.g. the kind of
display) of the wise can be changed interactively; type 'h' to see
help on this.
