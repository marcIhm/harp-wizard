harpwise ('wise' for short) supports the daily practice of bends,
scales, intervals or licks on a diatonic (richter) or chromatic
harmonica for various keys.

The wise is limited to play and recognize single notes only, so that
e.g. chords or octaves are out of its reach.

The first argument on the commandline specifies the mode of operation;
it can be one of:

  - listen: The wise listens to your playing, e.g. to monitor bends or scales
  - quiz: Train your ear and musical memory
  - licks: Learn licks (licks not included, but some pointers)
  - play: Wise plays scales, holes or licks
  - report: Produce reports about licks and tags or a journal of licks played
  - calibrate: Wise generates samples for holes, or you record your own

to read more details, usage examples and options for the individual
modes, invoke them without arguments, e.g.

  harpwise listen


After the first argument (which specifies the mode) some additional
arguments may be given:

  - type: mostly 'richter' or 'chromatic' but other choices might be
    defined. If ommitted, this defaults to 'richter'.

  - key: key of harp, e.g. 'c' or 'g' or 'af' (a flat) or
    'ds' (d sharp). If ommitted, this defaults to 'c'.

  - scale: scale on which you want to concentrate, e.g. 'blues',
    'major_pentatonic' or 'all'. No default.

An example using all these arguments would be:

  harpwise listen richter c blues

,which (relying on defaults), could also be written as:

  harpwise listen blues   


The possible scales depend on the chosen type of harmonica:

Besides the arguments for type, key and scale, there are a lot of
options (introduced by '-'), some requiring an argument themselves.
All options are described in the usage info of the various modes.

Most arguments and options can be abreviated, e.g 'lis' for 'listen',
'cal' for 'calibrate' or '-t' for '--tags-any'.

Also note, that for most modes, the behaviour (e.g. the kind of
display) of the wise can be changed interactively; type 'h' to see
help on this.
