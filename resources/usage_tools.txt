OVERVIEW

  The mode 'tools' offers some non-interactive but useful utilities,
  which are mostly related to basic harmonica theory; they do not use
  microphone or speaker.

  The required additional argument specifies the tool to run;
  it can be one of:

  - transpose: transpose a sequence of notes from one key of harp
    to another
  - positions: simply print out a chart of positions
  - chart: print the usual harmonica chart with notes, matching the
    given key
  
USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Transpose a sequence of notes (but specified by their hole) from
  the key of c to g:

    harpwise tools transpose c g -1 +2 -3

  note, that no all notes maybe available on the harp of the new key.


  Print the simple table of positions:
  
    harpwise tools positions
    

  Print a harmonica chart for the key of g

    harpwise tools chart g

  The same chart, but arguments rearranged

    harpwise tools g chart
