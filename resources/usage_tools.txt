OVERVIEW

  The mode 'tools' offers some non-interactive but useful utilities,
  which are mostly related to basic harmonica theory; they do not use
  microphone or speaker.

  The required additional argument specifies the tool to run;
  it can be one of:

  - transpose: transpose a sequence of notes from one key of harp
    to another, keeping notes and pitches
  - shift: similar, but shift by given number of semitones (e.g. 12st)
    or named interval
  - keys (or positions): print a chart with keys and positions,
    with optional arguments to mark key of harp and key of song
  - intervals: print all known intervals with, semitones and names
  - chords: print the chords i, iv and v for the given key of harp as
    played in second position
  - chart: print harmonica chart with notes for the given key; specify
    a scale to see see it laid out on the harp (second chart)
  - search-in-licks: search given sequence of holes among licks,
    matching equivalent holes too
  - edit-licks: a convenient way to edit your lick file
  - edit-config: edit your personal configuration
  - transcribe: estimate a sequence of holes, that matches the given
    lick or music-file
  
USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Transpose a sequence of notes (but specified as holes) from
  the key of c to g (keeping the notes/pitches constant):

    harpwise tools transpose c g -1 +2 -3


  Shift a sequence of notes by a given number of semitones:

    harpwise tools shift 12st -1 +2 -3

  (this is different from transposing the notes/pitches as given
  before, as it changes the pitches of the notes)

  You may then let harpwise play the resulting notes, even if they
  have no hole on the harp (more play)


  Print a simple table of keys and positions:
  
    harpwise tools keys

  Center the semitone-column around a specific key of harp (bf) and
  mark it in the table:

    harpwise tools key bf

  The same and mark a key of song (d) too:

    harpwise tools key bf d
    

  Print a harmonica chart for the key of g:

    harpwise tools chart g

  The same chart, but with arguments rearranged

    harpwise tools g chart
    
  Two charts, the second with scale-content

    harpwise tools g chord-i chart --add-scales -

  Four charts, the third and fourth with intervals of each hole to the
  given reference:

    harpwise tools chord-i chart --ref -4

  instructive error message.
