OVERVIEW

  The mode 'tools' offers some non-interactive but useful utilities,
  which are mostly related to basic harmonica theory; they do not use
  microphone or speaker.

  The required additional argument specifies the tool to run;
  it can be one of:

  - transpose: transpose a sequence of notes from one key of harp
    to another
  - positions: print a fixed chart with positions
  - chords: print the chords i, iv and v for the given key of harp as
    played in second position
  - chart: print harmonica chart with notes for the given key; specify
    a scale to see see it laid out on the harp (second chart)
  
USAGE BY EXAMPLES

  Transpose a sequence of notes (but specified by their hole) from
  the key of c to g:

    harpwise tools transpose c g -1 +2 -3

  note, that no all notes maybe available on the harp of the new key.


  Print the simple table of positions:
  
    harpwise tools positions
    

  Print a harmonica chart for the key of g:

    harpwise tools chart g

  The same chart, but arguments rearranged

    harpwise tools g chart
    
  Two charts, the second with scale-content

    harpwise tools g chord-i chart
    
  Three charts, the third with intervals of each hole to the given
  reference:

    harpwise tools chord-i chart --ref -4
