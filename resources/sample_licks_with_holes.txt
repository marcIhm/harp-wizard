# A lick (juke) can be defined like this:
#

[juke]
  holes = -1 -2/ -3// -3 -4 -4
  # this will be shown at the bottom of the screen, when the lick
  # is played.
  desc = a classic lick by Little Walter
  # we have a recording for this lick; will be searched in subdir 'recordings'.
  rec = juke.mp3
  # next two lines are optional; useful if you only want to play
  # part of the recording
  rec.start = 2.2
  rec.length = 4
  # This has the tags 'samples' and 'favorites', that can be used
  # to select among a larger number of licks
  tags = samples favorites
  # Key of 'c' is the default anyway, use this if the recording
  # is done with a different harmonica
  rec.key = c

#
# The above lick is only a sample and only for richter harp.
# See further down below for more examples with more explanation.
#
# You will need to add some more licks and recordings, before the
# mode 'licks' can really be useful.
#
# To get started end you may search the web; make sure, to grep 
# audio samples too or record them yourself. For example, see
#
#   https://www.harmonica.com/6-blues-riffs/
#
# for a handful of great licks.
#
#
# Much more extensive are these two books with lots of licks,
# complete with AUDIO SAMPLES:

# Once you have defined more than a dozen licks, you may want to
# reduce typing efford when adding a new lick. This can be done
# by setting some default-information and reusing it in many
# licks.
#
# To this end there are two Special sections:
#
#   [vars]     defining global variables to be used in tags;
#              may help to save some typing.
#   [default]  define values, that will be included in any lick;
#              works only for tags; in an individual lick you
#              may override or add to this.
#
# both sections are optional, so you may just omit them.
#


[default]
  # This applies for all licks until overwritten by another [default];
  # tags specified in the individual lick will be added
  tags = samples
  desc = The sample licks

[special]
  # A lick requires a series of holes ('holes =') to be played,
  # but may also contain special accustic events (e.g. '(pull)') 
  # that are recognized by the surrounding parens and will 
  # not be played; they just serve as a kind of reminder.
  holes = -1 +1 -2+3 (pull) -1
  # This lick adds a tag to those given by the defaults
  tags.add = advanced
  # You may also add to the description
  desc.add = Notice the pull
  # unfortunately no recording

[vars]
  # Variables may help to save typing; they are useful in tags
  $source = theory

[default]
  # notice the use of the variable
  tags = scales $source

[blues]
  holes = +1 -1/ -1 -2// -2+3 -3/ +4 -4/ -4 -5 +6 -6/ -6 +7 -8 -9 +9 -10
  # has tags 'scales' and 'theory'

[mape] # major pentatonic
  holes = -1 +2 -2+3 -3// -3 -4 +5 +6 -6 -7 -8 +8 +9
  # has tags 'scales' only
  tags = scales
