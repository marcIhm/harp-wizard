Utility scripts, not needed for normal operation of harpwise, but
useful for some advanced or special use-cases.

* harpwise_historic_with_fzf.sh
  
  Bash-function for an interactive search in the history of invocations
  of harpwise.

  This uses fzf (fuzzy-finder, which must be installed first) and may
  provide a more specific search experience than the standard
  history-search of your shell.

  The file contains some additional comments on how to put it into
  use.
