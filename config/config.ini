#
# This file contains the global configuration for harpwise
#
# Please do not modify; rather override values in
#
#   ~/.harpwise/config.yaml
#
# ,which will be created on first invocation of harpwise.
#

#
# This file has 5 sections:
#
# The first section [any-mode] defines default values for all modes,
# which may be overriden in one of the three sections for the
# individual modes, [listen], [quiz] and [licks].
#
# These four sections together define the interactive behaviour of
# harpwise and may be overridden by commandline arguments: e.g. the
# key 'comment' from this file will only be effective, if no option
# '--comment' is given on the commandline.
#
# The fifth and final section [general] has values, that can only be
# changed here and are not available as options. They mostly have
# influence on the inner workings of harpwise.
#
# Remark: Even if you do not change a value here and do not specify it
# as a commandline-argument, you may change its values (at least in
# many cases) interactively, while harpwise is running; type 'h' for
# help on this.
#
# In this file, watch out for keys, that contain an underscore,
# e.g. 'add_scales': their corresponding commandline-argument has a
# minus instead, e.g.  '--add-scales'.
#
# And note, that some commandline-options, e.g. '--partial' or
# '--start-with', cannot be stored in this config, the rationale
# beeing, that they do not lend themselves to beeing set once and for
# all.
#

[any-mode]
  # Type is the second argument on the commandline (after the mode),
  # that may be omitted in some cases, in which it is retrieved from
  # the line below
  type = richter
  # Key is the third commandline argument; define its default
  key = c
  # likewise for scale
  scale = blues

  #
  # Keys, that can also be set as commandline arguments; see e.g.
  # 'harpwise quiz' for a description
  #
  display = chart-scales
  comment = note
  add_scales = chord-i,chord-iv,chord-v
  fast = true
  immediate = false
  loop = true
   
[listen]

[quiz]
  comment = holes-some

[licks]
  comment = holes-all
  immediate = true
  tags_any = 

# Please note, that there is no section [report], because this mode 
# simply takes all its values from [licks]

[general]

  # Normally the way you write your scale (with flats or with sharps),
  # determines, what harpwise will use; only if the scale has none
  # of them, the config below will decide
  pref_sig_def = flat

  
  # The value of time_slice below determines, how often harpwise will
  # detect the hole currently played; the default setting of 0.1
  # seconds will allow at maximum 5 hole-changes to be distinguished
  # in one second; which (apart from warbling) is faster, than many
  # people will want to play.

  # time_slice will be multiplied with sample_rate below to
  # get size of aubiopitch buffer
  time_slice = 0.1

  #
  # Remark: Changing any of the values below may lead to unexpected
  # results; your mileage may vary
  #

  # Algorithm used by aubiopitch; see its man page for choices
  # (e.g. schmitt, fcomb, ...)
  pitch_detection = yinfast

  # Any extra arguments, that need to be passed to arecord in your
  # specific setup (an example would be: -D pulse); try this if
  # harpwise fails and complains about arecord. In such a case you may
  # need to experiment with arecord directly from the
  # commandline. Once you have found some relevant extra options, you
  # may put them here.
  arecord_extra =

  # Any extra argument that aplay needs:
  aplay_extra = 

  # The sample rate used to drive aubiopitch and arecord
  sample_rate = 48000
