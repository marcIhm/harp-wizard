#
# This file contains the global configuration for harpwise
#
# Please do not modify; rather override some values in
# ~/.harpwise/config.yaml
#

#
# This file has 5 sections:
#
# Three sections (listen, quiz, licks) specify values for different
# modes respectively; the section [any-mode] defines default values
# for all modes, which may be overriden in one of the sections for
# modes.
#
# All these values serve as defaults for the respective
# commandline-options; e.g. the key 'comment' is used, if no option
# '--comment' is given on the commandline
#
# Please note, that quite some commandline-options, e.g. --partial or
# --start-with, cannot be set in this config, as they do not lend
# themselves to beeing set once and for all.
#
# A final section [general] has some technical values, that cannot be
# set as options.
