The configuration is distributed among various files and directories.

- Technical config:

  - config.json :: Main config file, e.g. with standard names of musical
                   config-files; see comments within for some explanations.
		   
  - config_merge.json :: Optional, may contain any of the keys from
       config.json and overrides the standard values if present; not checked
       into git.


- Musical config:

  - intervals.json :: Intervals, that you want to displayed with a name; can
                      be changed almost at will.

  - E.g. in directory diatonic

    - harps.json :: Notes for harps of different keys.

    - scale_holes.jsoN :: Definition of scales		    


To adjust configuration you may add config_merge.json to override settings.
You may even change some of the filenames in config.json (by adding them to
config_merge.json); this might helpful, if you want to name the holes of your
harp differently.
