The configuration is distributed among various files and directories.

Technical config:

  - config.json :: Main config file; see comments within for some
                   explanations.
		   
  - config_merge.json :: Optional, may contain any of the config-keys from
       config.json and then overrides those; not included in git-versioning.

  - intervals.json :: Names for selected intervals.

Each type of harmonica (e.g. diatonic) has its own musical config in its own
directory:

  - intervals.json :: If this file is present within a subdirectory, it
                      overrides the one directly below config.

  - harps.json :: Notes for harps of different keys; the key-names used here
                  must be a subset of the parameter all_keys given in
                  config.json.

  - scale_holes.json :: Definition of scales; the scale-names used here must
       be a subset of the parameter all_scales given in config.json.


To adjust configuration you may add config_merge.json to override selected
settings.

You may create a new type of harmonica (e.g. bagpipe-tuning) by copying one of
the existing dirs (e.g. diatonic) to a new name (bagpipe) and modyfy the
contained files accordingly.
