The configuration is distributed among various files and directories.

Technical Config:

  - config.json :: Main config file; see comments within for some
                   explanations.
		   
  - config_merge.json :: Optional, may contain any of the config-keys from
       config.json and then overrides those; not included in git-versioning.

  - intervals.json :: Names for selected intervals.


Each type of harmonica (e.g. diatonic) has a directory with its own 
Musical Config:

  - intervals.json :: If this file is present within a subdirectory, it
                      overrides the one directly within config.

  - keys.json :: Maps keys to maps of holes to notes.

  - scales.json :: Maps scales to list of holes.


To adjust configuration you may add config_merge.json to override selected
settings (e.g. the default harmonica-type).

You may create a new type of harmonica (e.g. bagpipe-tuning) by copying one of
the existing dirs (e.g. diatonic) to a new name (bagpipe) and modyfy the
contained files accordingly.
