Testing the scripts from the top-level directory "install" is done via docker.

* Build a docker image

  (in harpwise/tests/installer)

    docker build -f dockerfile.ubuntu --progress=plain \
                 --no-cache -t harpwise_ubuntu:latest $HOME

  or 

    docker build -f dockerfile.fedora --progress=plain \
                 --no-cache -t harpwise_fedora:latest $HOME

* Run the image 

  and verify the usage information:

    docker run -it harpwise_ubuntu:latest

  or

    docker run -it harpwise_fedora:latest


  As the script tests all (?) its dependencies on each invocation, a
  successfull usage-information already proves, that the scripts for
  installing dependencies from directory install do work.

  (add '--entrypoint /bin/bash' to investigate, if not)

* However

  harpwise itself however, cannot run from within a container
  without setting up the sound-system manually.
