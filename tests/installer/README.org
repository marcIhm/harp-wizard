Testing the scripts from the top-level directory "install" is done via podman.

* Build a podman image

  (in harpwise/tests/installer)

    podman build -f podman.ubuntu --no-cache -t harpwise_ubuntu:latest $HOME

  or 

    podman build -f podman.fedora --no-cache -t harpwise_fedora:latest $HOME

* Run the image 

  and verify selftest:

    podman run -it harpwise_ubuntu:latest

  or

    podman run -it harpwise_fedora:latest


  The selftest will output 'Selftest okay.' as its final line.
  If not, add '--entrypoint /bin/bash' to investigate.

* However

  harpwise itself however, cannot run from within a container
  without setting up the sound-system manually.
