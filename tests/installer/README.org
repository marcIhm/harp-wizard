Build a docker image with

  docker build -f build-with-script --progress=plain --no-cache -t harp_scale_trainer:latest $HOME

if successful, run the image and see the usage information:

  docker run -it harp_scale_trainer:latest

this proves, that the script install-dependencies-on-ubuntu.sh does work.

harp_scale_trainer itself however, cannot run from within a container
without setting up the sound-system manually.
