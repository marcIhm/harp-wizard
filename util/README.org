Utility scripts, not needed for normal operation of harpwise, but
useful for some advanced users or special cases.

- timed.rb :: Remote control for harpwise with a time table, e.g to
  switch licks while playing a backing track
- harpwise_historic_with_fzf.sh :: bash-function to use fzf (fuzzy
  finder) and the invocation-files of harpwise for an interactive
  selector in the history of invocations

Maybe see the comments in the individual files for more description.
