.SH NAME

.B harpwise
- practice harmonica with your microphone and speaker

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B harpwise
.RB {MODE}
.RB {ARGUMENTS}
.RB [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B harpwise
('wise' for short) supports the daily practice of bends,
scales, intervals or licks on a diatonic (richter) or chromatic
harmonica for various keys.

The wise is limited to play and recognize single notes only; it has no
sense of chords or grooves. So from the three ingredients of music,
melody, harmony and rhythm, it can help you with the melody only.

The primary documentation of harpwise is its usage information, that
can be retrieved by calling it without arguments:
.IP
harpwise
.RE

this man page has the very same information (so you may keep on
reading ...); but there are more usage informations for the individual
modes, which are not available as man-pages (see below, on how to get
them).

.SH MODE

When invoking harpwise, the first argument on the commandline
specifies the mode of operation; it can be one of:
.IP - 2
.B listen:
The wise listens to your playing, e.g. to monitor bends or scales
.IP -
.B quiz: 
Train your ear and musical memory
.IP -
.B licks: 
Learn licks (licks not included, but some pointers)
.IP -
.B play: 
Wise plays scales, holes or licks
.IP -
.B report: 
Produce reports about licks and tags or a journal of licks played
.IP -
.B calibrate: 
Wise generates samples for holes, or assists in recording your own
.IP -
.B tools: 
A collection of simple, non-interactive tools
.RE

to read more details, usage examples and options for the individual
modes, invoke them without arguments, e.g.
.IP
harpwise listen
.RE

.SH ARGUMENTS

After the first argument (which specifies the mode) some additional
arguments may be given:
.IP - 2
.B type:
mostly 'richter' or 'chromatic' but other choices might be defined. If
ommitted, this defaults to 'richter'.
.IP -
.B KEY: 
key of harp, e.g. 'c' or 'g' or 'af' (a flat) or 'ds' (d sharp). If
ommitted, this defaults to 'c'.
.IP -
.B SCALE:
scale on which you want to concentrate, e.g. 'blues', 'major_pentatonic' or 'all'. No default.
.RE

An example using all these arguments would be:
.IP
harpwise listen richter c blues
.RE

,which (relying on defaults), could also be written as:
.IP
harpwise listen blues   
.RE

The possible scales depend on the chosen type of harmonica:

scales for chromatic: all, blues, major, major_pentatonic, one, two
  scales for richter: all, blues, chord-i, chord-iv, chord-v, drawbends, 
    major_pentatonic, middle, minor_pentatonic, mixolydian, root
  scales for testing2: all, blues, major, major_pentatonic, one, two
  
.SH OPTIONS

Besides the arguments for type, key and scale, there are a lot of
options (introduced by '-'), some requiring an argument themselves.
All options are described in the usage info of the various modes.

Most arguments and options can be abbreviated, e.g 'lis'
for 'listen', 'cal' for 'calibrate' or '-t' for '--tags-any'.

Also note, that for most modes, the behaviour (e.g. the kind of
display) of the wise can be changed interactively; type 'h' to see
help on this.
