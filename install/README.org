Install dependencies for harp_scale_trainer for different
linux-distributions.

The trainer itself needs no installation but should rather be started
directly from its toplevel directory.


The scripts to install dependencies are:

  - install-dependencies-on-ubuntu.sh : may be suitable for other
    debian-based systems too

  - install-dependencies-on-fedora.sh : might also work on systems
    derived from fedora

Both scripts are fairly simple and you are invited to inspect them
before running them.


Please note, that after this installation you should be able to record
and play sound via alsa, e.g.:

  - arecord -d 1 foo.wav
  - aplay foo.wav

however, any configuration issues which might arise are beyond the
scope of this readme.


As a maintainer, see tests/installer for a way to test these scripts
in a container.
