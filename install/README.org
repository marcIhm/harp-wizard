Install dependencies for harp_scale_trainer for different linux-distributions.

The trainer itself needs no installation but should rather be started
directly from its toplevel directory.


The scripts to install dependencies are:

  - install-dependencies-on-ubuntu.sh  :  may be suitable for other debian-based systems too

  - install-dependencies-on-fedora.sh  :  might also work on systems derived from fedora

Both scripts are fairly simple and you are invited to inspect them before running them.


As a maintainer, see tests/installer for a way to test these scripts
in a container.
