* Harp Scale Trainer

[[images/harmonicas.jpg]]

Simple ruby script to help practice scales (e.g. blues or major pentatonic) on a
(datonic) richter or chromatic harmonica for various keys.

Its main operation modes are 'listen' and 'quiz'.

The first screenshow is from mode 'listen': The program has recognized a note
from the blues scale and marks it in the harmonica chart.

The second screenshot is from mode 'quiz': The program has played five notes
intially and now challenges to play them back.

* Installation

  The program harp_scale_trainer runs in the linux console; it has no formal
  installation, but rather runs directly from within the directory you need to
  clone from github first. Vice versa it can be removed by removing the cloned
  directory.

  harp_scale_trainer relies on several external programs for its operation,
  e.g.: aubiopitch, pulseaudio, aplay, arecord, sox, figlet and gnuplot. Their
  existence is checked on program start.
  
  Special thanx to aubiopitch for doing all the heavy-lifting of tone
  recognition !

  For MS Windows, version 11, you may use the latest windows-Subsystem for
  Linux wslg, which supports sound via remote desktop protocol.

* Usage

  Get usage information by invoking without arguments:
  
    ./harp_scale_trainer

  
  First you will need to calibrate the program; the resulting wav-files will
  be kept in directory samples (which is not checked into git).
