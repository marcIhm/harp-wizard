Simple ruby script to help practice scales (e.g. the major pentatonic)
on a blues harp on various keys.

harp_scale_trainer.rb runs in the linux console and requires
several external programs for its operation: aubiopitch, arecord,
aplay, figlet and ffmpeg.

Special thanx to aubiopitch for doing all the heavylifting of
tone recognition !

Currently this program needs to run as root (!) to allow access to
alsa devices.

The set of frequencies used for recognition is kept in the file
frequencies.yaml samples for each note are stored in folder samples.
Before using this program, you need to pupulate both with the special
mode 'calibrate'. This needs to be done only once.
