# -*- fill-column: 80 -*-

Simple ruby script to help practice scales (e.g. blues or major pentatonic) on a
diatonic harmonica for various keys.

Its operation modes are 'learn' and 'quiz'.

The screenshot below is from mode 'quiz': The program has played five notes
intially and now challenges me to play them back. I just played the third note,
six blow, correctly and now I try to hit the fourth note.

* Installation

  harp_scale_trainer runs in the linux console and requires several external
  programs for its operation: aubiopitch, pulseaudio, aplay, arecord, figlet and
  toilet (for additional figlet-fonts).
  
  Special thanx to aubiopitch for doing all the heavylifting of tone recognition
  !

  For MS Windows you may use the latest windows-Subsystem for Linux wslg, which
  supports sound via pulseaudio.

* Usage

  Get usage information by invoking without arguments:
  
    ./harp_scale_trainer

  
  First you will need to calibrate the program for at least one key by playing
  your own harp as requested; this needs to be done once only.
