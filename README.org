* Harp Scale Trainer

  [[images/harmonicas.jpg]]

  Simple ruby script to help practice scales (e.g. blues or major pentatonic) on a
  (diatonic) richter or chromatic harmonica for various keys.

  Its main operation modes are 'listen' and 'quiz'.
  
  The first screenshow is from mode 'listen': The program has recognized a note
  from the blues scale and marks it in the harmonica chart.

  The second screenshot is from mode 'quiz': The program has played five notes
  intially and now challenges to play them back.

* Usage

  Get usage information by invoking without arguments:
  
    ./harp_scale_trainer

  
  First you will need to calibrate the program; the resulting wav-files will
  be kept in directory samples (which is not checked into git).

* A word on holes

  The Program uses the term "holes" throughout to give you feedback or hints.
  Examples would be "-1" or "+4"; these obviously name the holes of your
  harmonica and distinguish between "draw" and "blow"; a special name like
  "-2+3" is used as a common name, if two holes ("-2" and "+3") produce the
  same note.

  So, if such a hole-name is given, you always know the note that sounds, when
  the hole is played (at least for a given key of harmonica).

  In effect, you may consider hole-names like "-2+3" as practical names for the
  notes played on a harmonica of a given key.

* Installation

  The program harp_scale_trainer runs in the linux console (no graphical
  environment needed); it has no formal installation, but rather runs directly
  from within the directory, which you need to clone from github first. Vice
  versa it can be completely removed by removing the cloned directory.

  harp_scale_trainer is written in ruby, so you need ruby installed.

  Moreover it relies on several external programs for its operation, e.g.:
  aubiopitch, pulseaudio, aplay, arecord, sox, figlet and gnuplot. Their
  existence is checked on program start.
  
  Special thanx to aubiopitch for doing all the heavy-lifting of tone
  recognition !

  For MS Windows, version 11, you may use the latest windows-Subsystem for
  Linux wslg, which supports sound through the remote desktop protocol.

* Making the screenshots

  With these commandlines:

  ./harp_scale_trainer listen richter c blues --screenshot

  ./harp_scale_trainer quiz 5 richter c blues --screenshot
