Simple ruby script to help practice scales (e.g. blues or major pentatonic) on a
diatonic harmonica for various keys.

Its operation modes are 'listen' and 'quiz'.

The screenshot below is from mode 'quiz': The program has played five notes
intially and now challenges me to play them back. I just played the third note,
six blow, correctly and now I try to hit the fourth note.

* Installation

  The program harp_scale_trainer runs in the linux console; it has no formal
  installation, but rather runs from within the directory you need to clone
  from github first.

  harp_scale_trainer requires several external programs for its operation:
  aubiopitch, pulseaudio, aplay, arecord, sox and figlet. Their existence is
  checked on program start.
  
  Special thanx to aubiopitch for doing all the heavy-lifting of tone
  recognition !

  For MS Windows you may use the latest windows-Subsystem for Linux wslg, which
  supports sound via pulseaudio and rdp.

* Usage

  Get usage information by invoking without arguments:
  
    ./harp_scale_trainer

  
  First you will need to calibrate the program; the resulting wav-files will
  be kept in directory samples.
