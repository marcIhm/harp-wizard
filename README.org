Simple ruby script to help practice scales (e.g. blues or major
pentatonic) on a diatonic richter harp for various keys.

Its operation modes are 'listen' and 'quiz'. The screenshot below is
from mode 'listen': I played one blow, and the program has recognized
this, but renders it in red, because it does not belong to the chosen
scale.

* Installation

  harp_scale_trainer.rb runs in the linux console and requires several
  external programs for its operation: aubiopitch, pulseaudio, figlet
  and toilet (for additional figlet-fonts).
  
  Special thanx to aubiopitch for doing all the heavylifting of
  tone recognition !

  For MS Windows you may use the latest windows-Subsystem for Linux
  wslg, which supports sound via pulseaudio.

* Usage

  Get usage information by invoking without arguments:
  
    ./harp_scale_trainer.rb

  First you will need to calibrate the program by playing your own harp.
  This needs to be done only once (but for every key you want to use).
