Regarding copyrights:

The three licks in this directory are short phrases taken from
these songs:

- "Wade in the water" an "African American jubilee song", whose lyrics
  were first published in 1901.

- "The Saint Louis Blues" is a popular American song composed by
  W. C. Handy and published in September 1914.

- "Going Down The Road Feeling Bad" is a traditional American folk
  song; the first known recording is from 1923 by Henry Whitter.

(mostly citing the Wikipedia)

So, as far as I can tell, these songs are in the Public Domain, either
they are traditionals with unknown authors or their copyright has
expired.  See https://12bar.de/cms/albums/public-domain-blues-songs/
for some background.

The actual recordings in this directory are done by me (Marc Ihm) and
so I am free to release these sample under the same license as the
program itself; see the file LICENSE in the toplevel directory.


The backing track 12bar-lofi.mp3 has also been created by the author
of this program, using ableton live as a DAW.
