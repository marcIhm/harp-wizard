Regarding copyrights:

The three licks in this directory are short phrases taken from
these songs:

- "Wade in the water" an "African American jubilee song", whose lyrics
  were first published in 1901.

- "The Saint Louis Blues" is a popular American song composed by
  W. C. Handy and published in September 1914.

- "Going Down The Road Feeling Bad" is a traditional American folk
  song; the first known recording is from 1923 by Henry Whitter.

(mostly citing the Wikipedia)

Therefore these songs are in the Public Domain. Either
they are traditionals with unknown authors or their copyright has
long expired.  Their recordings have been done by me.

The simple backing track 12bar.mp3 too has been created by me,
using ableton live as a DAW.

All mp3-files in this directory have been recorded / created
by me (Marc Ihm) and are released under the same license as
the program harpwise itself; see the file LICENSE in
